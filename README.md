Stats:
- ~45,000 leads reduced to ~26,000 solid leads.

Data Cleansing Project:
- Determine which leads are garbage, good or duplicates and assign an action.
- Merge all duplicates into one row by selecting the "best" field from all possible rows available (dates are not available)
- Assign appropriate action (aka Merge & Purge, Retain, etc.,) and provide a Merge ID reference if row is assigned Merge/Purge Status
- Create a .csv file of "good leads" & another of "Merge & Purge" or "Purge" Action tags


Learning Goal:
- Develop a deeper understanding of how to use dictionaries and lists as a tool to manipulate, cleanse/reduce and improve a fairly large 
data set.


Todos:
- Code should be less procedural
- Code should be more general and less "specific" to this cleansing task (so that major pieces are available for reuse)
- I want to learn how to use some of Python's built-ins to increase performance and reduce the number of lines
